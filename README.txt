Notes/My Experiences:
Their tutorial is very indepth and is pretty non-technical in the beginning, which I liked.
They have a colorspace of diverging just like we learned about in the colorbrewer paper
Tried to open disk_out_ref2 with a text editor. Data was not stored in plaintext.
Working through the tutorial I got to see how each individual feature was very useful.
The clip function seemed extremely useful to work on or analyze the insides of models. 
The way that clips are handled as subsections of surfaces also is very intuitive and allows easy toggling of objects(Pipes?)
I was able to get my hands on some scans of test subjects heads from the stanford volume data archive and mess around with that.

I was able to volumetrically visualize the brain and then also make easy slices along different axis to analyze the brain. I feel like this could easily be used by doctors to help diagnose tumors.
While I didn't get my code filtering it because I'm an idiot, I know I used both contour and multiple clips for my visualization. 
I also learned that pvm can't be opened by the program. Is that because it's proprietary or because it can't handle the data?
I downloaded some other test input data, but it required me to enter more parameters into paraview for it to functionally visualize the data.
Is it possible to export models you create to common 3d formats. E.g. Something you could 3d print. I made a silly oreo cookie when I was first learning the program. 
I like the Read -> Filter -> Render process and it makes a lot of sense. 


Review of program:
It seems like a very powertool for scientific visualization and data wrangling. The program is full of features! This is perfect for researchers handling large amounts of data and looking at data in 3 Dimensions.
What I learned that you should know coming in, is that you should understand how the dataset that you are passing into the program is created and handled. For example, I came in not knowing about the dataset that they used (.ex2) and I couldn't replicate it, when I was trying to create synthetic data.
The tutorial is excellent, but I feel like this program would take years to truly master, but it is also not too hard to learn the basics for researchers.(I feel it's easier than competitors at least for basic features)
Despite all this praise, the program still crashed on me a few times(and caused a full computer freeze of my high power desktop) and also doesn't support some common proprietary formats which I tried. Kitware claims the program scales well across distributed computing but I wasn't able to test that myself. Maybe if the school gave us all free computing clusters(heh).
